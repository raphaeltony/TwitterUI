# TwitterUI
Task 1 of the Hasura Product Development Fellowship Programme

This app was made as part of the first task in the HPDF programme. The students were requested
to replicate 3 screens from twitter - The timeline, search and the profile. The app is made using React Native and we used predefined
components from the Native Base framework.

## Setting Up The Environment:

  - Follow the steps as mentioned in "Getting Started" section of react-native website in the 
  "Build with native code" tab. Then run the following commands 
  
  - git clone https://github.com/raphaeltony/TwitterUI.git
  
  - cd TwitterUI
  
  - npm install (to install project dependencies)
  
  - react-native run-android (This will run the app on your connected emulator or development device)
